                    <h2>Xianzhou Cangcheng</h2>
                    <p>The Xianzhou Cangcheng was one of the nine Flagships owned by the fleet that would become the Xianzhou Alliance. According to Jingliu, the Cangcheng was once the most bustling of Xianzhou ships.<br>
                    The Cangcheng Plum Blossom, which belongs to the genus of Prunus and the family Rosaceae, was a native species of the Xianzhou Cangcheng. It became extinct following the destruction of the Cangcheng. Now, it has an appearance of a plant that gives out a bluish glow as its image is used as a model for virtual bonsai dendronette.
Stone Calf Cimicifugae Infusion is a remedy from the Cangcheng's Collection of Prescriptions that is aimed at soothing excessive teeth growth in Xianzhou natives and can effectively cure obstructed teeth growth for approximately twenty years.</p>
                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p class="montserrat-font-light">At the end of the year of 2609 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Cangcheng, along with the Yuque, Yuanqiao, Xuling, all introduce their own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. During the formation of the Xianzhou Alliance, the seven ships gathered with a Xuling messenger to authenticate, share content, and review the details. This declaration is the final product, hereby creating the Xianzhou Alliance.</p>

                        <p class="montserrat-font-light">During the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium — Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war breaks out as a result. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation are released to counter the invasion — including the Reignbow who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi.</p>
                        
                        <p class="montserrat-font-light">Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, which was closest to Muldrasil in the battle formation and used their famed bow "Xuanyuan", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu, which were both next to the Cangcheng on both sides in the battle formation. The arrow smashes into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrating Muldrasil. Between the Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar during the Crisis of Belief, followers of Qlipoth erected the Amber Palace on the Cangcheng.</p>
                        
                        <p class="montserrat-font-light">On the Year 6300 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Cangcheng is devoured by the activated planet Rahu, Devourer of Worlds. The scene of the destruction of the Xianzhou Cangcheng is a type of dire fortune that can be divined by Ruoyue of the Looking Bronze. The fortune's description reads "Fighting fire with woods will only fuel the flames."</p>
                        
                        <p class="montserrat-font-light"><strong>Legacy</strong></p>
                        
                        <p class="montserrat-font-light">Jingliu, one of the few survivors of the Cangcheng, was the former Sword Champion and master of the Luofu's Arbiter-General, Jing Yuan, and trained him in swordsmanship. She went on to become one of the members of the legendary High-Cloud Quintet along with her student, becoming heroes amongst the Xianzhou.</p>
