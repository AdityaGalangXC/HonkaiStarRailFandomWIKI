                    <h2>Xianzhou Luofu</h2>
                    <p>Xianzhou Luofu is one of the six flagships of the Xianzhou Alliance. It sails in the endless ocean of stars like a one-way arrow, shooting toward the destined enemy of the Lord of The Hunt.

                        After the war with the Denizens of Abundance, the Luofu traveled between densely populated interstellar regions, trading and conducting cultural exchange between different worlds. They signed agreements with the Interastral Peace Corporation, and helped many worlds ravaged by the Denizens of Abundances to rebuild their ecosystem. People arrived at the Luofu to seek medical treatment, study, and trade, with throngs of visitors filling the docks.
                        
                        Though warfare has receded, the Luofu has not relaxed its watch against the Denizens of Abundance. The starskiffs of the Cloud Knights would head to planets that went out of contact to seek information, while the Xianzhou Ten-Lords Commission remains on guard for any Elixir Seeker pursuing everlasting life â€” The desire for immortality is the beginning of all tragedies. The Xianzhou will not allow any younger civilizations to walk its old path.</p>
                        <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-font-light">The inside of the Luofu comprises of delves which total space exceeds the ship in size. This is possible due to the Xianzhou's space-folding technology. These delves all varied in size and shape, but they were all on a scale that was just too large for any normal ship to contain. Some of the delves could hold up entire residential and commercial districts, such as Exalting Sanctum, while others could even contain vast luxuriant prairies like the Ever-Hunt Plains, which hosts fauna such as monkeys and fawn. The visible space in the bustling skyport of Central Starskiff Haven is enough to fill up the entire Luofu. The bustling street of Starwatcher Avenue can also be found here, where shops line the road for as far as the eye can see, and their lights are lit for perpetuity. The Sky-Faring Commission's headquarters on the Luofu is the Palace of Astrum, which also acts as the ship's bridge. Cloudford is the trade cargo port of the Loufu. Goods from various worlds are delivered by transport starskiffs and unloaded at Cloudford, and every day it unceasingly handles huge amounts of port traffic.</p>
    <p class="montserrat-font-light">Starskiffs on the Luofu are manufactured in Stargazer Navalia. Aurum Alley is the Exalting Sanctum's signature food street where tourists come to enjoy delicious food, from traditional dishes to roadside snacks, and experience street culture. The freight dock managed by the Aurum Alley Merchant Guild is mainly used for distributing commodities and logistics transportation. Fyxestroll Garden is garden delve created centuries ago by Foxian crafters temporarily occupied by the Ten-Lords Commission as the imprisonment site for Heliobi that escaped from the Artisanship Commission's Creation Furnace.</p>
    <p class="montserrat-font-light">Within the courtyard walls between the thresholds of Locufox Forest and Foxsomn Tomb lies a forest of bamboo sprouting from bewildering stones. Upon these rocks exists a place of condolence for those in grief to expel their pain. The outside of the Pavilion of Cessation, the Ten-Lords Commission Special Operations Team for the Heliobi Containment Breach Incident's meeting point, forms a corridor decked with sittable sills between the pillars. This offers people a place to rest for a moment and enjoy the coolness or hide from the rain. Additionally, they may also direct their attention toward the Pavilion of Fragrance and appreciate ongoing operatic performances.</p>
    <p class="montserrat-font-light">The Swallowsong Pavilion is for banquets and composing poetry in Fyxestroll Garden. In ancient times, those of literary virtue enjoyed coming to the pavilion to exchange cups of libations and engage in poetic construction, naming this place to be a "sanctum of wine and lyricality." Craftsmen seized the opportunity to circulate the running waters through the confines of the park from the water-facing Verdant Terrace entrance and let nature flourish in sprouts of bamboo and thickets of flora elegance, instilling the richness of rustic woodland upon the area.</p>
    <p class="montserrat-font-light">The Divination Commission hosts the Luofu's Matrix of Prescience Ultima. Conclave Hall is the official location in the Divination Commission delve where issues are discussed publicly. The Seat of Divine Foresight is office of the Arbiter-General of the Luofu. The Luofu's Alchemy Commission borders the Vidyadhara delve of Scalegorge Waterscape which hosts the sealed entrance to the Ambrosial Arbor, the Luofu's Plaguemark. The Alchemy Commission's medical texts are kept in the Elixir Research Terrace, a building looking out over the sea. Medicine and traders
