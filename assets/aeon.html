                    <h2>Aeon</h2>
                    <p class="montserrat-font-light"><br>
                        People know very little about the mysterious existence that dwells in the vast stellar seas. With the limitation of knowledge, intelligent lifeforms can only faintly discern that Aeons tread upon paths imperceptible to mortal beings and execute unfathomable powers via some form of belief. In the end, the Aeons became an embodiment of highly condensed concepts of philosophy through the word of mouth spread of their legends.<br><br>
                        If anyone finds themselves treading on the Path of an Aeon, they will be inundated by a distant sensation, like being struck by a gaze from light-years across the cosmos. Many believe that this is the only connection the Aeons and mortals can ever have.They call them "Aeons" in this cosmos. They construct reality, erase stars, and leave their marks on countless worlds. Together with your companions, you’ll travel across the cosmos on the Astral Express, following the path once traveled by the Aeons. From here, you will explore new civilizations, meet new comrades, and begin new adventures among countless fantastical worlds. All the answers you seek will be uncovered among the stars. What are you waiting for? Are you ready to begin this trailblazing journey?</p>
                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aeons can only operate according to their Primum Mobile, i.e. they are incapable of doing anything contrary to their Path. Himeko describes this phenomenon as a restriction that Aeons must suffer, noting that Akivili enjoyed a freedom similar to mortals despite being restrained by their Primum Mobile.</li>
                        <li>The visible forms of Aeons that can be witnessed through the perception of mortals are assumed to be projections from a higher-dimensional world.</li>
                        <li>This is also referenced in Dan Shu’s diary when she describes how Lan "descended onto the physical plane," suggesting that Lan had not been present in the mortal realm until they were summoned by Fu Xuan's distress signal.</li>
                        <li>The Xianzhou's Divination Commission sorts Aeons into three categories:
                          <ul>
                            <li>"The Arbiters," who determine mortal births and deaths, and are highly connected to the rise and fall of civilizations. Lan and Qlipoth are among these.</li>
                            <li>"The Sacrosancts," who are difficult to predict as good or evil, with their ultimate destinations often unknowable. Nous, Akivili, Aha, and Idrila are among these.</li>
                            <li>"The Authors of Calamity," who are the main culprit behind all disasters. Yaoshi, Nanook, and Tayzzyronth are among these.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>According to Kafka, there are few known ways for an Aeon to die:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Paths with overlapping concepts eventually collide, and the broader Path engulfs the narrower one—Ena was assimilated by Xipe this way, in a process Herta compares to survival of the fittest. However, there are examples of similar Paths co-existing for different lengths of time, such as the Preservation with the Remembrance and the Abundance with the Propagation.</li>
                            <li>Aeons may kill other Aeons.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
