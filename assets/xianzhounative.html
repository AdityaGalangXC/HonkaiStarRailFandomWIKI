                  <h3>Xianzhou Natives</h3>
                  <p class="montserrat-font-light">Formally known as Homo celestinae, are a long-lived subspecies of humans originating from the nine ships that left the distant Xianzhou homeworld in search of the Aeon Yaoshi. In the present day, they are one of the three long-life species that compose the Xianzhou Alliance — the others being Foxians and Vidyadhara.</p>                  
                        <h3>Origin</h3>
                        <p class="montserrat-font-light">The Xianzhou natives originally came from a planet ruled by the Primeval Imperium. A Denizens of Abundance race, the wingweavers, attacked the Primeval Imperium. After defeating the invaders, the Primeval sovereign became fixated on immortality after obtaining miraculous recipes from captured wingweaver magicians. A fleet of nine ships were constructed and sent out into space to search for Yaoshi the Aeon of Abundance in order to obtain immortality.</p>

<p class="montserrat-font-light">Yaoshi the Aeon of Abundance bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor upon the Xianzhou Luofu. The Xianzhou people ate the Arbor's fruits and thus gained immortality. However, this came with a heavy price, as the people felt the long lasting negative effects of immortality, which they called "Mara". They began to resent Mara as it turned them into "Beasts".</p>
<p class="montserrat-font-light">The first Xianzhou immortal, known as "Primus Immortus", is still alive and imprisoned in the Shackling Prison. Their body routinely grows limbs, wings, bone spikes, and other bodily structures. The prisoner is eternally confined in an eight-feet square cell constructed from Celest-Gold, with walls no thinner than seven inches. The cell must possess the following features: high-temperature sterilization, an air filtration system, and the ability to administer calming gas. If the prisoner shows any signs of awakening, it must be immediately reported to the marshal.</p>
<h4>Biologi</h4>
<p class="montserrat-font-light">While Xianzhou natives are nearly indistinguishable from short-life humans in terms of outward appearance, their internal biology differs significantly. Xianzhou natives stop physically aging once they reach adulthood, and can remain in this unchanging state for upwards of a millennium if they are lucky. They have an average lifespan of about 800 years. Inevitably, however, all Xianzhou natives eventually succumb to the degenerative condition known as mara.</p>
<p class="montserrat-font-light">Because of their altered physiology, Xianzhou natives also have regenerative capabilities far beyond those of most short-life species. However, this comes with its drawbacks — many implants and body-altering technologies used by short-life species are entirely rejected by Xianzhou natives' bodies, which always revert back to their "default" state before long. Xianzhou natives have an organ known as their Core Esse. Some believe this to be the source of their regeneration and immortality.</p>
<p class="montserrat-font-light">Xianzhou natives cells can shift as needed between differentiated cells and stem cells. This conversion obeys specific rules that will never create a single error. The rule dictating this conversion is not set according to internal hormonal levels or any other parameters, but a "standard" set in stone the moment the individual was born. As cells shift between differentiation and omnipotence, the person's bodily characteristics are forever set at their original "standard."</p>
<p class="montserrat-font-light">This phenomenon, which goes against the fundamental creed of biology, is called the miracle of the Plagues Author. At a certain critical point of the long-life species' life cycle, this power from the Plagues Author will suddenly enter a new stage — the original standard will be over-written and the body will start to develop catastrophically, turning a civilized "human" into a mindless "abomination." This is what is commonly called "mara-struck."</p>
<p class="montserrat-font-light">Some doctors believe that because the people of the Xianzhou have immortal bodies, their memories accumulate until no more can be stored in the brain. Only the most vivid and extreme memories persist, but such memories are usually ones of regret, hatred, grief, and other negative emotions. That's when the symptoms of being stricken with mara begin to show. It is also believed that veteran soldiers are far more likely than everyday citizens to be stricken with mara due to post-traumatic stress.</p>
<p class="montserrat-font-light">Xianzhou natives with disabilities are known as "Incomplete Ones." Those born with missing limbs can have non-invasive prosthetic limbs attached, but for people with internal issues such as Dan Shu, non-intrusive methods are of little help. Attempting to replace a person's biological organs with artificial ones will result in the body eventually rejecting it, causing extreme pain for the person. Mara-stricken "Incomplete Ones" have been known to recover from their disabilities upon onset. Dan Shu noted one such case where a man born without limbs completely regrew them after being struck with mara. She also notes that there are no "Incomplete Ones" among the Borisin, another species with strong connections to the Abundance.</p>
                <h4>Culture</h4>
                <p class="montserrat-font-light">Because of their long lifespans, Xianzhou natives do not place much value on funeral ceremonies. Ordinarily, people approaching the end of their lives are guided to the Hall of Karma by the Ten-Lords Commission, before any symptoms of mara appear. They then wait for their time to come and peacefully give up their lives. However, there exists a funeral rite called the "soul-soothing ceremony," where the deceased person's belongings are placed on an empty starskiff and sent off to sail between the stars. This ceremony is usually performed for Cloud Knights who have died in battle or become mara-struck.</p>
