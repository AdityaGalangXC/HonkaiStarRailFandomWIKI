                    <h2>The Enigma of the Immortal Curse : Mara</h2>
                    <p class="montserrat-font-light">Mara, also called the "Long-Life Curse," refers to the negative effects that afflict long-life species at a certain point in their life cycle involving cell transformation that result in bodily growths and loss of sanity. Those afflicted by Mara have turned into monsters such as the Mara-Struck Soldier. The cause of mara is not entirely understood but different sources point toward either immortality obtained through Yaoshi The Abundance or the accumulation of memories and the inability to process them over a long period of time.</p>
                     <h3>Effect</h3>
                     <p class="montserrat-font-light">According to Jing Yuan, Yaoshi the Aeon of Abundance had once bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor upon the people of the Xianzhou Luofu, who ate its fruits and thus gained immortality. However, this came with a heavy price, as the people felt the long lasting negative effects of immortality, which they called "Mara". They began to resent Mara as it turned them into "Beasts". After Jingliu became mara-struck, she killed everyone in sight. The bodies of those inflicted by Mara grow and mutate until they lose their human form. It is said that the long-lived Xianzhou Natives would eventually be stricken with mara.</p>
                     <p class="montserrat-font-light">According to Amnesic Meditation Therapy: A Guide to A Long, Healthy Life!, over 80% of Xianzhou residents over the age of 800 suffer from being mara-struck and over 50% fail to celebrate their 900th birthday in a conscious state. Xianzhou natives such as Dahao's father can be afflicted with mara as early as 646 years of age. His father displayed pre-mara symptoms known as the five decays. He started asking questions about events during Dahao's childhood when he misbehaved that Dahao could not even remember. He stopped consuming food and water and stopped responding to people until he just sat like a corpse. However when he was taken away by the Ten-Lords Commission he managed to tell Dahao to "Take care of yourself."</p>
                     <p class="montserrat-font-light">According to Dan Shu's Diary, an autopsy on the corpse of a mara-struck person who had gone berserk showed that their congenital defects had disappeared. This was not a new discovery and such observations have been made many times throughout history. There are also no known Incomplete Ones (long-lived beings with congenital defects) among the borisin. It is implied that the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus fed long-lived patients mara-inducing pills that cured them of long-term disabilities but caused mental confusion and piercing pain all over the body.</p>
                     <h4>While inside the mara-struck body, I felt a vitality that is close to madness. How can I explain it to you - just like beasts are to humans, the mara-struck acts according to intuition and prioritizes their own survival over morals and ethics. But the difference between a mara-struck body's madness and that of a beast is even greater than the difference between a beast and a human... It's a more primitive form of life, a vitality that discards even the concept of corporeal existence.

                        According to Blade, everyone experiences mara in different ways, however his situation is unusual. Although mara haunts him, memories of it seldom cross his mind, be they of remorse, hatred, fear, or reflection. He describes himself as becoming something else when mara strikes.<sup>[9]</sup> According to Kafka he had been suffering from memory loss even before she found him.<sup>[10]</sup>

                        <h2>Causes</h2> 
                        <p class="montserrat-light-font">
                          According to records in the Cloud Knights Marital Doctrine, those who come into contact with Yaoshi the Aeon of Abundance can become struck with mara instantly. Even trying to divine the fate of Yaoshi will cause the diviner to become mara-struck. The mara-struck condition in long-life species can also be induced through medicinal pellets and pellet-infused smoke.<br><br>
                          
                          According to Dan Shu, mara is caused by the power of Yaoshi, from whom both the Foxians and Xianzhou natives obtained their long lifespans from. The ultimate secret to their immortality is the ability of their cells to shift between differentiated cells and stem cells when needed without creating a single error. A rule governing this conversion sets a "standard" at the moment of an individual's birth dictating their physical characteristics forever as their immortal cells shift between differentiation and omnipotence. This is called the miracle of the Plagues Author. However at a certain point in a long-life species' life cycle, the power of Yaoshi enters a new stage and the original standard is replaced, causing the body to develop catastrophically, turning into a "mindless abomination." This is referred to as being "mara-struck."<br><br>
                          
                          According to Fu Xuan, healers believe the mara-struck condition is related to memories. Long-life species still have a limited mental capacity. As time passes, memories fade but extreme and vivid recollections that are almost certainly filled with negative emotions remain, resulting in the loss of their ability to feel positive emotions. Bailu gives a similar description where the brain can no longer store any more memories and only the most vivid and extreme memories remain, which usually consist of regret, hatred, grief, and other negative emotions. This negative emotional state causes the collapse of the person's ego and starts setting off the mara-struck condition. Cases of mara have also been caused by high intensity pain. The Amnesic Meditation Therapy advertisement claims that the root cause of mara is excessive collection of meaningless memories and recommends removing those memories as a solution. Mara that has been temporarily suppressed by memory erasure can still be set off by over-stimulation, familiar faces, and locations. Retired Cloud Knights are the most likely to be stricken with mara due to post-traumatic stress.<br><br>
                          
                          Fu Xuan also says that mara is not unique to any one species and affects all long-life species, including Xianzhou natives, Foxians, and the Vidyadhara. However Foxians usually do not live long enough to be affected by mara and the Vidyadhara discard their past by molting. Dan Shu adds that the Vidyadhara do not derive their immortality from Yaoshi but Long the Permanence. Due to their unending cycle of reverting from maturity to infancy relying on continuous cellular transdifferentiation, they do not suffer the ailments of immortality that many other long-life species experience. Despite the rarity of mara-struck Foxians and Vidyadhara, it is implied by a Sky-Faring Commission Foxian that even they were susceptible to it during battle against the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus due to the pellet-infused smoke that elicit mara.

                          <h2>Treatment</h2>
                          <p class="montserrat-font-light">
                            Countless doctors and sages have tried to find a cure to mara but none have succeeded.<br><br>
                            
                            According to Dahao, mara is more similar to aging than a curable disease. It is inevitable but can be slowed down and won't cause any harm if it is controlled. When mara is about to strike, the Ten-Lords Commission takes the afflicted away. They are then thrown into the Shackling Prison.<br><br>
                            
                            Mara can be temporarily suppressed by removing one's memories or sensory deprivation. Kafka's Spirit Whisper ability is able to temporarily suppress Blade's mara. The suppression process involves removing Blade's memories of the Xianzhou and the High-Cloud Quintet, including himself and practically everything surrounding his relationship with Imbibitor Lunae. An advertisement for the amnesic meditation therapy device claims that by using the device, Xianzhou Natives can avoid being mara-struck and live well beyond the usual 800-900 years when they usually succumb to mara. Patients on which the device supposedly worked report forgetting painful memories and their childhood. Jingliu says that she wears a black veil as "proof of my resolve to never look back, to never fall again into mara and destruction." March 7th elaborates that Jingliu wears the black veil to prevent her from seeing sights on the Xianzhou that might trigger her mara. According to Luocha, Jingliu has found a solution to mara. Jingliu says that she made a deal that allowed her to retain what life she had left in her. She has her sanity but her mind is at its limits.<br><br>
                            
                            Bailu's treatments allowed Banxia to retain her consciousness for a short period of time after she transformed into a Mara-Struck Soldier.<br><br>
                            
                            The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus use a medication known as the Draught of Draconic Surge that uses the power of Long the Permanence to both trigger and control mara. The Draught is made using Vidyadhara bone marrow (living) and various other ingredients. Mauve Moon implied that the bone marrow was obtained using force when informing the Trailblazer on how to proceed with collecting the ingredients. The core principle of the Draught is to allow the stem cells in the Vidyahara bone marrow to function in the host. For long-life species, this can trigger mara and cause the bodily organs to "go out of control in a more controlled manner," allowing them to gain the benefits of being mara-struck while retaining their sanity. For short-life species, this medication causes "a rapid elevation of bodily capacities for a short duration, significantly improving the short-life species' fragile physiologies." However once all the Vidyadhara cells have perished, the host's body suffers a catastrophic regression that can perhaps only be prevented by other drugs from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. There is no antidote to the Draught. According to the prescription for the Draught, taking this medicine may cause severe pain all over the body, abnormal bone noises, and partial sight and hearing loss. Those who survive gain the way to immortality. The prescription says that the Vidyadhara should not take it.<br><br>
                            
                            The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have a prescription known as the Semblance Reversion Essence that allows those whose bodies have been altered by mara to return to their original forms. However this is only a temporary measure and repeated uses will reduce the prescription's potency until it loses effectiveness completely. The Disciples do not believe being mara-struck can be avoided, only slowed down, and consider it the first step to ascension given to them by Yaoshi.<br><br>
                            
                            Despite the Disciples' supposed ability to control mara, their members who were captured by the Cloud Knights during battle exhibited signs of delusion and hallucination. One disciple saw themselves becoming the storm, the Abundant Ebon Deer, and a scene of leaves and branches covering the sky. Another disciple claimed that to be mara-struck was to eliminate the self, to achieve transcendance, a true life of freedom, and a second life gifted by Sanctus Medicus. The Disciples are also able to elicit uncontrollable mara through smoke infused with medicinal pellets.

                            <p class="montserrat-font-light"><br>
                              After succumbing to Mara and going insane, Jingliu managed to escape Starskiff Haven in the Year 7380 (Star Calendar) and easily froze all the Cloud Knights sent after her before Jing Yuan defeated her in battle.<br><br>
                              
                              Yingxing, originally a short-life species human, was affected by Mara when he used Shuhu's flesh to help Dan Feng resurrect Baiheng but failed. As a result, he was turned into Blade and thereby relies on Kafka's Spirit Whisper to suppress the Mara inside him. He states that "We are all mara-stricken in different ways, but my situation is unusual. Although the mara haunts me, memories of it seldom cross my mind, be they of remorse, hatred, fear, or reflection" and also says "When the mara strikes... I become something else."
